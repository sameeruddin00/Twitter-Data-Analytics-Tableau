## Dataset Description

This dataset represents a large collection of customer support tweets collected from Twitter. It is designed for training conversational models and analyzing customer-company interactions.

### Dataset Overview:
- **Source**: Collected from Twitter.
- **Format**: CSV file, where each row corresponds to a tweet.
- **Description**: Each conversation in the dataset includes at least one customer request and at least one response from a company.
- **Purpose**: The dataset is intended for analyzing customer service interactions on Twitter and building models for customer support automation.

### Columns in the Dataset:
1. **tweet_id**:
   - A unique, anonymized ID for the Tweet.
   - This ID is referenced by `response_tweet_id` and `in_response_to_tweet_id`.

2. **author_id**:
   - A unique, anonymized user ID. 
   - The "@" sign in usernames has been replaced with associated anonymized user IDs.

3. **inbound**:
